[Verse 1]
Planning something all day
Another great escape
I knew my plans would take away
From me some things I love

[Chorus]
Take it all back now
Let it all fall down
Take it all back now
Let it all fall down

[Verse 2]
These mistakes I've made
Helped bring me here today
I've been to hell and back
I know it's all inside my brain

[Chorus 2] [X5]
Take it all back now
Let it all fall down
